This error occurs when you try to access a property of a component's state or props before the component has mounted. This typically happens inside the component's constructor or before the componentDidMount lifecycle method has completed.  Consider this example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { data: this.props.initialData }; // Error prone!
    console.log(this.state.data); // Also error prone!
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Component Mounted:', this.state.data);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `this.props.initialData` might not be defined yet during the constructor's execution.  Accessing `this.state.data` before it's properly set leads to undefined behavior.
